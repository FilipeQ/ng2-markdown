**NOTICE: [Here Be Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)**

This project is in a very early alpha state. None of the code herein has been tested/proven.

If you're feeling adventurous (read masochistic) you can try to get it working. Otherwise wait a bit until I sort out the issues.

Issues:
- [ ] not registered in the JSPM registry
- [ ] only works with ES6 + experimental decorator support
- [ ] should provide a transpile-to-ES5 version by default
- [ ] should include a test.html that demonstrates usage

If you want to see an *actual* working implementation of this, I encourage you to check out the source of [evanplaice.com](http://github.com/evanplaice/evanplaice.com).

Contributions are always welcome.

For new features:
- submit an issue with a basic proposal
- fork and create a new feature branch
- submit a PR that references the issue

*Note: Feature requests start with a proposal so developers don't waste time/effort implementing changes that won't be included.*

For bug fixes:
- submit an issue describing the bug (if one doesn't already exist)
- submit a PR that references the issue
